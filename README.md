Hi,
this is my first time writing docs
here we go,

## Description of the problem and solution.

The problem was to create a single page e-commerce-like fornt-end website.
the website is the solution with filters and searchbar etc.

## Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.

The task was only Front-end so, the solution focuses on the Front-end.

## Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.

fastest to write for me and easiest to remember as well.

## Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

Trade-offs: clean, ordered and, easy-to-read code.
anything left out: That would be a mistake or something I forgot to do, nothing left by freewell.
might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project: Responsivity fixes, UX/UX imporvements and Coloring.

I hope that's All.
Best Wishes,
Salah Elraies.
